# FaceMaskDetection
With CoronaVirus being the highlight of recent times, this project created using Python, Tensorflow, MobileNet and OpenCV helps detect mask on a person's face on live camera.
This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19 and can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.
